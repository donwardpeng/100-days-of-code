# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 4, 2019
##### (Start of Flutter Project - worked on navigation between pages)

**Today's Progress**: Added navigation between two pages.

**Thoughts:** Learned how to add navigation between pages with Flutter using the Navigator and push/popping screens from the stack. Also learned to use the SizedBoxwidget to ensure a widget fills the entire width of a screen.

### Day 1: March 5, 2019
##### (Started on TensorFlow.js Project)

**Today's Progress**: Started on TensorFlow.js Project

**Thoughts:** Learned how to load a pretrained Keras model into a JavaScript file using TensorFlow.js.

### Day 2: March 6, 2019
##### (Continued on TensorFlow.js Project)

**Today's Progress**: Continued on TensorFlow.js Project. Ran data through the model.

**Thoughts:** Learned how to run a array throught the TensorFlow model using the tf.predict method. Needed to create a proper sized tensor to allow the data to be used in the method. Interesting how JavaScript arrays are typically rowsxcolumns and creating tensors can change all of it.

### Day 3: March 7, 2019
##### (Continued on Flutter Project - continued on passing info between pages)

**Today's Progress**: Passing info between pages.

**Thoughts:** Learned how to move data between two pages using than syntax (similar to promises in JavaScript.

### Day 4: March 8, 2019
##### (Continued on TensorFlow.js Project)

**Today's Progress**: Refactored the array that I was using for the tf.predict method to be a tensor. Also tested out the model using an tensor consisting of all 1's. Worked on the JavaScript to collect data for the model.

**Thoughts:** I have a better understanding of tensors and with the most recent TensorFlow Dev Summit, having been able to get a better idea of how TensorFlow.js fits into the entire ecosystem.

### Day 5: March 9, 2019
##### (Continued on Flutter Project)

**Today's Progress**: Added the Product Image to the Product Details page. Learned how to overide the back buttons on the Product's Page. Added a login screen to the app, and used the Navigator push_replacement method to remove the login screen from the stack. 

**Thoughts:** Learned more screen control and app flow code today.

### Day 6: March 10, 2019
##### (Continued on Flutter Project)

**Today's Progress**: Learned about and added a Hero Animation. Refactored the Add Image button to a FAB. Started to figure out animations and planning ahead for animations on the product details page. 

**Thoughts:** Learned a bit about animations today - need to learn more tomorrow
