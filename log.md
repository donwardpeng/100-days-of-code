# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 4, 2019
##### (Start of Flutter Project - worked on navigation between pages)

**Today's Progress**: Added navigation between two pages.

**Thoughts:** Learned how to add navigation between pages with Flutter using the Navigator and push/popping screens from the stack. Also learned to use the SizedBoxwidget to ensure a widget fills the entire width of a screen.

### Day 2: March 6, 2019
##### (Continued on TensorFlow.js Project)

**Today's Progress**: Continued on TensorFlow.js Project. Ran data through the model.

**Thoughts:** Learned how to run a array throught the TensorFlow model using the tf.predict method. Needed to create a proper sized tensor to allow the data to be used in the method. Interesting how JavaScript arrays are typically rowsxcolumns and creating tensors can change all of it.
