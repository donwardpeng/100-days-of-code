# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 4, 2019
##### (Start of Flutter Project - worked on navigation between pages)

**Today's Progress**: Added navigation between two pages.

**Thoughts:** Learned how to add navigation between pages with Flutter using the Navigator and push/popping screens from the stack. Also learned to use the SizedBoxwidget to ensure a widget fills the entire width of a screen.
