# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 4, 2019
##### (Start of Flutter Project - worked on navigation between pages)

**Today's Progress**: Added navigation between two pages.

**Thoughts:** Learned how to add navigation between pages with Flutter using the Navigator and push/popping screens from the stack. Also learned to use the SizedBoxwidget to ensure a widget fills the entire width of a screen.

### Day 1: March 5, 2019
##### (Started on TensorFlow.js Project)

**Today's Progress**: Started on TensorFlow.js Project

**Thoughts:** Learned how to load a pretrained Keras model into a JavaScript file using TensorFlow.js.

### Day 2: March 6, 2019
##### (Continued on TensorFlow.js Project)

**Today's Progress**: Continued on TensorFlow.js Project. Ran data through the model.

**Thoughts:** Learned how to run a array throught the TensorFlow model using the tf.predict method. Needed to create a proper sized tensor to allow the data to be used in the method. Interesting how JavaScript arrays are typically rowsxcolumns and creating tensors can change all of it.

### Day 3: March 7, 2019
##### (Continued on Flutter Project - continued on passing info between pages)

**Today's Progress**: Passing info between pages.

**Thoughts:** Learned how to move data between two pages using than syntax (similar to promises in JavaScript.

### Day 4: March 8, 2019
##### (Continued on TensorFlow.js Project)

**Today's Progress**: Refactored the array that I was using for the tf.predict method to be a tensor. Also tested out the model using an tensor consisting of all 1's. Worked on the JavaScript to collect data for the model.

**Thoughts:** I have a better understanding of tensors and with the most recent TensorFlow Dev Summit, having been able to get a better idea of how TensorFlow.js fits into the entire ecosystem.

### Day 5: March 9, 2019
##### (Continued on Flutter Project)

**Today's Progress**: Added the Product Image to the Product Details page. Learned how to overide the back buttons on the Product's Page. Added a login screen to the app, and used the Navigator push_replacement method to remove the login screen from the stack. 

**Thoughts:** Learned more screen control and app flow code today.

### Day 6: March 10, 2019
##### (Continued on Flutter Project)

**Today's Progress**: Learned about and added a Hero Animation. Refactored the Add Image button to a FAB. Started to figure out animations and planning ahead for animations on the product details page. 

**Thoughts:** Learned a bit about animations today - need to learn more tomorrow

### Day 7: March 11, 2019
##### (Day Off - Wife's Birthday and we got a new puppy.)

** Day Off

### Day 7: March 12, 2019
##### (Continued on Flutter Project)

**Today's Progress**: Added username and password fields to the app. Used the ObscureField property of the TextField to create a password field. Still need to figure out how to add the password lock icon beside the password field without the row blowing up. 

**Thoughts:** Need to dig deeper in how to manage width of widgets in a row.

### Day 8: March 13, 2019
##### (Continued on Flutter Project)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed issues with the row blowing up and added the password visibility button with full functionality for it on the login screen. 

**Thoughts:** The row widget in Flutter evaluates all of it's children to determine who fits where. By wrapping any variable sized elements in a Expanded Widget they are forced to take on the available space only and not cause the row to blow-up.

### Day 9: March 14, 2019
##### (Continued on Flutter Project)

**Today's Progress**: Added a navigation drawer, added another Hero image and integrated Firebase in the iOS app. 

**Thoughts:** Learned that the Navigator.pushReplacement method to change screens does not support Hero animations. Also learned how to add Firebase Integration to an iOS app in Flutter.

### Day 10: March 15, 2019
##### (Continued on Flutter Project)

**Today's Progress**: Started to integrate Firebase Analytics into Flutter. Followed the instructions, but ran into issue somewhere along the line since nothing is showing up yet. 

**Thoughts:** The Firebase docs for Flutter can somewhat difficult to follow. One pitfall of using a cross-platform development platform like Flutter is that sometimes you need to know a bit of the underlying platform.

### Day 11: March 16, 2019
##### (Continued on Flutter Project)

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work with Firebase Analytics. Analytics appears if I build the project in XCode, although it is still wonky. Learning a bunch about packages in Flutter. Next steps -> rebuild the project from scratch since I probably messed up some config file. I will copy over my existing code to the new project.  

**Thoughts:** The Firebase docs for Flutter can somewhat difficult to follow. One pitfall of using a cross-platform development platform like Flutter is that sometimes you need to know a bit of the underlying platform.

### Day 12: March 17, 2019
##### (Continued on Flutter Project)

**Today's Progress**: Started a new Flutter project with Firebase analytics added, and then added all of my screens and custom files. This made all of the project config work and Firebase analytics works well. Started a new git repo for the project.  

**Thoughts:** Sometimes it is worth restarting with a new project if config settings get messed up - especially if you have the luxury of doing so. I am learning well how Flutter's package system works.
